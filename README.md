Make Startup project: `Exchange.UI`

Build the solution

Move `available_currencies.xml` to `\bin\Debug\net8.0\Resources\` 

Command example: `Exchange -e usd/eur 22`


Used Tools: Visual Studio 2022, .NET 8.0, Copilot, GitHub, StackOverflow

Didn't use repository (UnitOfWork) pattern. From my point of view, such data as available currencies and currency rates must be obtained in real time.
